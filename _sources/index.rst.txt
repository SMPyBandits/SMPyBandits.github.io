Welcome to SMPyBandits documentation!
=====================================

**Open-Source Python package for Single- and Multi-Players multi-armed Bandits algorithms**.

A research framework for Single and Multi-Players Multi-Arms Bandits (MAB) Algorithms: UCB, KL-UCB, Thompson and many more for single-players, and MCTopM & RandTopM, MusicalChair, ALOHA, MEGA, rhoRand for multi-players simulations.
Runs on Python 2 and 3, open-source under the `MIT License <https://lbeson.mit-license.org/>`_.

.. note::

    See more on `the GitHub page for this project <https://github.com/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits/>`_: `<https://github.com/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits/>`_.
    The project is also hosted on `Inria GForge <https://gforge.inria.fr/project/admin/?group_id=9477>`_, and the documentation can be seen online at `<https://smpybandits.github.io/>`_ or `<http://http://banditslilian.gforge.inria.fr/>`_ or `<https://smpybandits.readthedocs.io/>`_.

This repository contains the code of `my <https://perso.crans.org/besson/>`_ numerical environment, written in `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_, in order to perform numerical
simulations on *single*-player and *multi*-players `Multi-Armed Bandits
(MAB) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit>`_ algorithms.

`I (Lilian Besson) <https://perso.crans.org/besson/>`_ have `started my
PhD <https://perso.crans.org/besson/phd/>`_ in October 2016, and this is
a part of my **on going** research since December 2016.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you use this package for your own work, please consider citing it with this piece of BibTeX: ::

    @misc{SMPyBandits,
        title =   {{SMPyBandits: an Open-Source Research Framework for Single and Multi-Players Multi-Arms Bandits (MAB) Algorithms in Python}},
        author =  {Lilian Besson},
        year =    {2018},
        url =     {https://github.com/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits/},

        note =    {Code at https://github.com/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits/, documentation at https://smpybandits.github.io/}
    }

I also wrote a small paper to present *SMPyBandits*, and I will send it to `JMLR MLOSS <http://jmlr.org/mloss/>`_.
The paper can be consulted `here on my website <https://perso.crans.org/besson/articles/SMPyBandits.pdf>`_.
