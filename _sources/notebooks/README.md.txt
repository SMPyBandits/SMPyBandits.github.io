# [Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.jupyter.org/) :notebook: by [Naereen @ GitHub](https://naereen.github.io/)

This folder hosts some [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/), to present in a nice format some numerical experiments for [my AlgoBandits project](https://github.com/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits/).

> [The wonderful Jupyter tools](http://jupyter.org/)  is awesome to write interactive and nicely presented :snake: Python simulations!

## 1. List of experiments presented with notebooks
### MAB problems
- [Easily creating various Multi-Armed Bandit problems](Easily_creating_MAB_problems.ipynb), explains the interface of the [`Environment.MAB`](../Environment/MAB.py) module.

### Single-Player simulations
- [A simple example of Single-Player simulation](Example_of_a_small_Single-Player_Simulation.ipynb), comparing [`UCB1`](../Policies/UCBalpha.py) (for two values of $\alpha$, 1 and 1/2), [`Thompson Sampling`](../Policies/Thompson.py), [`BayesUCB`](../Policies/BayesUCB.py) and [`kl-UCB`](../Policies/klUCB.py).
- [*Do we even need UCB?*](Do_we_even_need_UCB.ipynb) demonstrates the need for an algorithm smarter than the naive [`EmpiricalMeans`](../Policies/EmpiricalMeans.py).
- [Lai-Robbins lower-bound for doubling-tricks algorithms with full restart](Lai_Robbins_Lower_Bound_for_Doubling_Trick_with_Restarting_Algorithms.ipynb).

### Multi-Player simulations
- [A simple example of Multi-Player simulation with 4 Centralized Algorithms](Example_of_a_small_Multi-Player_Simulation__with_Centralized_Algorithms.ipynb), comparing [`CentralizedMultiplePlay`](../PoliciesMultiPlayers/CentralizedMultiplePlay.py) and [`CentralizedIMP`](../PoliciesMultiPlayers/CentralizedIMP.py) with [`UCB`](../Policies/UCB.py) and [`Thompson Sampling`](../Policies/Thompson.py).
- [A simple example of Multi-Player simulation with 2 Decentralized Algorithms](Example_of_a_small_Multi-Player_Simulation__with_rhoRand_and_Selfish_Algorithms.ipynb), comparing [`rhoRand`](../PoliciesMultiPlayers/rhoRand.py) and [`Selfish`](../PoliciesMultiPlayers/Selfish.py) (for the "collision avoidance" part) combined with [`UCB`](../Policies/UCB.py) and [`Thompson Sampling`](../Policies/Thompson.py) for learning the arms. Spoiler: `Selfish` beats `rhoRand`!

## Experiments
- [Can we use a (non-online) Unsupervised Learning algorithm for (online) Bandit problem ?](Unsupervised_Learning_for_Bandit_problem.ipynb)
- [Can we use a computationally expensive Black-Box Bayesian optimization algorithm for (online) Bandit problem ?](BlackBox_Bayesian_Optimization_for_Bandit_problems.ipynb)

## 2. Question: *How to read these documents*?

### 2.a. View the _notebooks_ statically :memo:
- Either directly in GitHub: [see the list of notebooks](https://github.com/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits/search?l=jupyter-notebook);
- Or on [nbviewer.jupiter.org](http://nbviewer.jupiter.org/): [list of notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits/).

### 2.b. FIXME not yet - Play with the _notebooks_ dynamically :boom:
[![MyBinder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits)

Anyone can use the [mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org/) website (by [clicking](http://mybinder.org/repo/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits) on the icon above) to run the notebook in her/his web-browser.
You can then play with it as long as you like, for instance by modifying the values or experimenting with the code.

----

## 3. Question: *Requirements to run the notebooks locally*?
All [the requirements](requirements.txt) can be installed with [``pip``](https://pip.readthedocs.io/).

> Note: if you use [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/) instead of [Python 2](https://docs.python.org/2/), you *might* have to *replace* ``pip`` and ``python`` by ``pip3`` and ``python3`` in the next commands (if both `pip` and `pip3` are installed).

### 3.a. [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) and [IPython](http://ipython.org/)

```bash
sudo pip install jupyter ipython
```

It will also install all the dependencies, afterward you should have a ``jupyter-notebook`` command (or a ``jupyter`` command, to be ran as ``jupyter notebook``) available in your ``PATH``:

```bash
$ whereis jupyter-notebook
jupyter-notebook: /usr/local/bin/jupyter-notebook
$ jupyter-notebook --version  # version >= 4 is recommended
4.4.1
```

### 3.b. My numerical environment, [`AlgoBandits`](https://github.com/SMPyBandits/SMPyBandits/)

- First, install its dependencies (`pip install -r requirements`).
- Then, either install it (*not yet*), or be sure to work in the main folder.

> *Note:* it's probably better to use [*virtualenv*](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/), if you like it.
> I never really understood how and why virtualenv are useful, but if you know why, you should know how to use it.
