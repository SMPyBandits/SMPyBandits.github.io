# **Non-Stationary Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits**

A well-known and well-studied variant of the [stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) is the so-called **Non-Stationary Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits**.
I give here a short introduction, with references below. If you are in a hurry, please read the first two pages of [this recent article instead (arXiv:1802.08380)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08380).

- The first studied variant considers *piece-wise* stationary problems, also referred to as **abruptly changing**, where the distributions of the `$K$` arms are stationary on some intervals `$[T_i,\ldots,T_{i+1}]$` with some abrupt change points `$(T_i)$`.
    + It is always assumed that the location of the change points are unknown to the user, otherwise the problem is not harder: just play your [favorite algorithm](docs/Policies.html), and restart it at each change point.
    + The change points can be fixed or randomly generated, but it is assumed that they are generated with a random source being oblivious of the user's actions, so we can always consider that they were already generated before the game starts.
    + For instance, [`Arms.geometricChangePoints()`](docs/Arms.html#Arms.geometricChangePoints) generates some change point if we assume that at every time step `$t=1,\ldots,T]$`, there is a (small) probability p to have a change point.
    + The number of change points is usually denoted `$L$` or `$\Upsilon_T$`, and should not be a constant w.r.t. `$T$` (otherwise when `$T\to\infty$` only the last section counts and give a stationary problem so it is not harder). Some algorithms require to know the value of `$\Upsilon_T$`, or at least an upper-bound, and some algorithms try to be efficient without knowing it (this is what we want!).
    + The goal is to have an efficient algorithm, but of course if `$\Upsilon_T = \mathcal{O}(T)$` the problem is too hard to hope to be efficient and any algorithm will suffer a linear regret (i.e., be as efficient as a naive random strategy).

- Another variant is the **slowly varying** problem, where the rewards `$r(t) = r_{A(t),t}$` is sampled at each time from a parametric distribution, and the parameter(s) change at each time (usually parametrized by its mean). If we focus on 1D exponential families, or any family of distributions parametrized by their mean `$\mu$`, we denote this by having `$r(t) \sim D(\mu_{A(t)}(t))$` where `$\mu_k(t)$` can be varying with the time. The slowly varying hypothesis is that every time step can be a break point, and that the speed of change `$|\mu_k(t+1) - \mu_k(t)|$` is bounded.

- Other variants include harder settings.
    + For instance, we can consider that an adversarial is deciding the change points, by being adaptative to the user's actions. I consider it harder, as always with adversarial problems, and not very useful to model real-world problems.
    + Another harder setting is a "pseudo-Markovian rested" point-of-view: the mean (or parameters) of an arm's distribution can change only when it is sampled, either from time to time or at each time step. It makes sense for some applications, for instance [Julien's work (in SequeL Inria team)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julien-seznec-29364a104/), but for others it doesn't really make sense (e.g., cognitive radio applications).

TODO fix notations more precisely, include definitions!
TODO what are the lower-bounds given in the more recent articles?

## Applications

*TL;DR*: the world is non stationary, so it makes sense to study this!

TODO write more justifications about applications, mainly for IoT networks (like when I studied [multi-player bandits](MultiPlayers)).

## References

Here is a partial list of references on this topic. For more, a good starting point is to read the references given in the mentioned article, as always.

### Main references

1. It is not on non-stationary but on non-stochastic (i.e., adversary) bandits, but it can be a good reading for the curious reader. [["The Non-Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandit Problem". P. Auer, N. Cesa-Bianchi, Y. Freund and R. Schapire. SIAM journal on computing, 32(1), 48-77, 2002](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/S0097539701398375)].

    + They are implemented in [`Policies.SlidingWindowUCB.SWUCB`](docs/Policies.SlidingWindowUCB.html#Policies.SlidingWindowUCB.SWUCB) and [`Policies.DiscountedUCB`](docs/Policies.DiscountedUCB.html).
    + Note that I also implemented the non-anytime heuristic given by the author, [`Policies.SlidingWindowUCB.SWUCBPlus`](docs/Policies.SlidingWindowUCB.html#Policies.SlidingWindowUCB.SWUCBPlus) which uses the knowledge of the horizon `$T$` to *try to* guess a correct value for `$\tau$` the sliding window size.
    + I implemented this sliding window idea in a generic way, and [`Policies.SlidingWindowRestart`](docs/Policies.SlidingWindowRestart.html) is a generic wrapper that can work with (almost) any algorithm: it is an experimental policy, using a sliding window (of for instance `$\tau=100$` draws of each arm), and reset the underlying algorithm as soon as the small empirical average is too far away from the long history empirical average (or just restart for one arm, if possible).

Srivastav. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.08380, 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08380)], introduced the first algorithms that can (try to) tackle the two problems simultaneously, [`LM-DSEE`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.LM_DSEE.html) and [`SW-UCB#`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.SWHash_UCB.html).
    + They require to know the rate of change but not the number of changes. They either assume that the number of break points `$\Upsilon_T$` is `$\mathcal{O}(T^\nu)$` for some `$\nu\in(0,1)$` (for abruptly-changing), or that the rate of change is `$\max_t |\mu_{t+1} - \mu_{t}| \leq \varepsilon_T = \mathcal{O}(T^{-\kappa})$`. In both cases, their model assumes to know `$\nu$` or `$\kappa$`, or an upper-bound on it.
    + One advantage of their algorithms is their simplicity and ability to tackle both cases!

    + They use a generic idea of [expert aggregation](Aggregation.md) with [an efficient tracking of a growing number of expert](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01615424/). The basic idea is the following: a new expert is started *at every time*, and at a breakpoint, the expert started just after the breakpoint will essentially be the most efficient one (and we need efficient tracking to know it).
    + Their `MemoryBandit` algorithm is very efficient empirically, but not easy to implement and it requires a large memory (although some discussion is given in their article's appendix, as they evoke an heuristic that reduces the storage requirement).

## Example of simulation configuration

A simple python file, [`configuration_nonstationary.py`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/configuration_nonstationary.html), is used to import the [arm classes](Arms/), the [policy classes](Policies/) and define the problems and the experiments.
The [`main.py`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/main.html) file is used to import the configuration and launch the simulations.

For example, we can compare the standard [`UCB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.UCB.html) and  [`Thompson`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.Thompson.html) algorithms, non aware of the non-stationarity, against the non-stationarity aware [`DiscountedUCB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.DiscountedUCB.html) [`SWUCB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.SlidingWindowUCB.html), and the efficient [`DiscountedThompson`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.DiscountedThompson.html) algorithm.

We also included our algorithms [`Bernoulli-GLR-UCB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.GLR_UCB.html) using [`kl-UCB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.klUCB.html),
and compare it with [`CUSUM-UCB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.CUSUM_UCB.html) and [`M-UCB`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies.Monitored_UCB.html), the two other state-of-the-art actively adaptive algorithms.

## Some illustrations

Here are some plots illustrating the performances of the different [policies](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Policies/) implemented in this project, against various non-stationary problems (with [`Bernoulli`](https://smpybandits.github.io/docs/Arms.Bernoulli.html) only).

### History of means for this simple problem

We consider a simple piece-wise stationary problem, with $K=3$ arms, a time horizon $T=5000$ and $N=1000$ repetitions.
Arm changes concern only one arm at a time, and there is $\Upsilon=4$ changes at times $1000,2000,3000,4000$ ($C_T=\Upsilon_T=4)$.

> Figure 1 : history of means $\mu_i(t)$ for the $K=3$ arms. There is only one change of the optimal arm.

### Comparison of different algorithms

By using the configuration snippet shown above, we compare 9 algorithms.
The plots below show how to perform.
Our proposal is the GLR-klUCB, with two options for **Local** or **Global** restarts (Generalized Likelihood Ratio test + klUCB), and it outperforms all the previous state-of-the-art approaches.
