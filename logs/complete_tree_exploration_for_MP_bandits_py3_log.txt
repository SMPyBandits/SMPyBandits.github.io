    Using these policies:
  - Player #0/2 uses Selfish_UCB_Ubar (which is <function Selfish_UCB_Ubar at 0x7f1769880950>)...
  - Player #1/2 uses Selfish_UCB_Ubar (which is <function Selfish_UCB_Ubar at 0x7f1769880950>)...
    Using these arms:
  - Arm #0/3 has mean mu_1 ...
  - Arm #1/3 has mean mu_2 ...
  - Arm #2/3 has mean mu_3 ...

There were 144 unique leafs for depth 2...


For depth 2, 0 leafs were found to be absorbing, and the probability of reaching any absorbing leaf is 0...

==> Numerically, for uniformly spanned means = [0.10000000000000001, 0.5, 0.90000000000000002], this probability is = 0 ...
